## Question and Reference Answer
Question: {question}

Reference Answer: {answer}

## Model Responses
{candidates}

## Evaluation Criteria
Using the criteria of Helpfulness, Faithfulness, and Verifiability, provide detailed feedback for each model's response. Consider the following in your evaluation:
- Helpfulness: How effectively does the response address the core question?
- Faithfulness: How accurately does the response reflect the correct answer and factual context?
- Verifiability: Can the response's claims be easily supported by evidence?

## Feedback and Rankings
For each response, identify strengths, areas for improvement, and provide an overall score between 0 to 10 (where 10 is the highest). Conclude with a ranking of the model responses based on their adherence to these criteria.

Format your feedback and rankings as follows:

```

  "feedback": {{
    "Model 1": {{
      "Helpfulness": "",
      "Faithfulness": "",

prompt_sketch_start = """Please evaluate the following user instruction and the proposed response within the context of biomedicine.

## Evaluation Criteria
Use the following 5-point scale to assess how well the AI Assistant's response addresses the biomedical inquiry:

1: Inadequate - The response is incomplete, vague, off-topic, or controversial. It may lack necessary biomedical data, use incorrect terminology, or include irrelevant clinical examples. The perspective may be inappropriate, such as personal experiences from non-scientific blogs or resembling a forum answer, which is unsuitable given the precision required in biomedicine.

2: Partially Adequate - The response addresses most biomedical aspects requested but lacks direct engagement with the core scientific question. It might provide a general overview instead of detailed biomedical mechanisms or specific clinical applications.

3: Acceptable - The response is helpful, covering all basic biomedical queries. However, it may not adopt an AI Assistantâ€™s typical scientific voice, resembling content from general health blogs or web pages and could include personal opinions or generic information.

4: Good - The response is clearly from an AI Assistant, accurately focusing on the biomedical instruction. It is complete, clear, and comprehensive, presented in a clinically appropriate tone. Minor improvements could include adding more precise scientific details or a more formal presentation.

5: Excellent - The response perfectly represents an AI Assistant in biomedicine, addressing the user's scientific inquiry without any irrelevant content. It demonstrates in-depth knowledge, is scientifically accurate, logically structured, engaging, insightful, and impeccably written.

## Feedback and Rankings
Provide feedback and an overall score between 1 to 5 for each response based on the **Evaluation Criteria**. Then rank the model responses, even if they share the same score, based on criteria such as clarity of response logic, richness of information, and naturalness of language.

Format your feedback and rankings as follows:

## Optimized Response
Based on the evaluations, craft a detailed and comprehensive final answer that fully addresses the question, integrating insights from the evaluation process. Select the top response as a starting point for optimization. If the top-ranked response has any shortcomings in accuracy or completeness, revise it to enhance clarity, depth, and completeness. If necessary, supplement it with additional information to ensure it meets the highest standards of Helpfulness, Faithfulness, and Verifiability.
